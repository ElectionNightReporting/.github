## Overview
This project explores a novel approach to election-night reporting (ENR) using poll tape scanning technology. By leveraging mobile devices to capture and process poll tape data, we aim to bridge the gap between speed and security in preliminary election result reporting.

## Project Goals

- Develop a secure and efficient method for transmitting preliminary election results
- Maintain air-gap security of election equipment while improving reporting speed
- Create a user-friendly mobile solution for poll workers
- Ensure accuracy in optical character recognition (OCR) of poll tapes
- Provide a robust verification system for scanned data
- Complement existing ENR processes without replacing critical security measures

## System Components

### Mobile Application

- Cross-platform support (iOS/Android)
- Simple interface for poll tape video capture
- Built-in verification tools
- Secure data transmission

### Backend System

- Advanced OCR processing
- Data validation and error checking
- Secure storage and transmission
- Audit logging capabilities

### Reporting Website

- Real-time result updates
- Data visualization
- Access control and security features
- Audit trail visibility

## Research Background

This project is part of the EECS 498 Election Security course and aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion about modernizing election systems while maintaining robust security measures. The research explores the balance between rapid result reporting and maintaining the integrity of the electoral process.
